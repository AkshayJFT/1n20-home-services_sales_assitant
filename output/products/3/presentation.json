The glass fibers create a rigid, stable matrix that resists warping and adds long‑term strength, while titanium dioxide acts as a UV shield, preventing the polymer from breaking down under harsh sunlight. Weatherable pigments are chemically bonded into the material so even deep, dark colors retain their richness without fading, and impact modifiers absorb dents and dings from hail or accidental contact. Integrated flame retardants slow the spread of smoke and flames, enhancing safety without compromising aesthetics. Together, these components give ASCEND a water‑resistant surface that repels moisture, eliminates rot, and maintains its appearance year after year.",
